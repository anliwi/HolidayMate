    attributes
    -----------------------
    Logo : Label
        The logo image.
    QuestionTag : Text
        The question to be asked to the user.
    a1 : str
    a2 : str
    answ1 : Button
        The affirmative answer button, calls setResponse().
    answ2 : Button
        The negative answer button, calls setResponse().
    clearing : Button
        Calls clear(), clears answer selection.
    next : Button
        Calls question(), displays next question.
    toMenu : Button
        Calls menuCreator(), goes back to main menu.
    lock : bool
        Mutex that prevents further appending of answers or loadng of questions until the first answer has been saved and the next question calculated.
    response : bool
        Stores current user response to latest question.
    nodes : list
        Values are alternating booleans and strings. Saves questions asked and user's answers in order for decision tree traversal.
    
    methods
    -----------------------
    question()
        Calls decTree::getNextNode() to get the next node.
        In case the next node is a question to ask, it loads and displays the question.
        In case the next node is the final suggestion, it retrieves data for the suggestion from the database and displays it.
    
    setResponse(value : bool)
        Sets response attribute to value.
        Controlled by lock attribute.
        
    questionClearer()
        Clears previously displayed question.
				
			Menu:
				A class to represent the initial stage of the User Interface on the window of the application.

		classes:
			decTree:
				A class used to represent a decision tree.

    attributes
    ----------------
    nodes : list
        A list of alternating attributes and their values.
    df : dataframe
        Required pandas dataframe.

    Methods
    ----------------
    getTree()
        Returns tree.

    getNextNode(nodes : list)
        Returns (bool, node) according to user input and previously generated decision tree.
        First value is 1 if returning a suggestion, 0 if returning the next attribute to question
    
    fit(df : dataframe, maxDepth=6)
        Call initially to generate tree, no return value but generates tree.

    calcEnt(attr : str, df : dataframe)
        Calculates and returns entropy.

    buildTreeRec(df : dataframe, currDepth : int, maxDepth : int)
        Recursively generates tree with recursion depth controlled by maxDepth.

    createTree(df : dataframe, maxDepth : int)
        Gives initial call for the recursive function and returns decision tree.
