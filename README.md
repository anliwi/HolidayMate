# HolidayMate
Ever wondered where to go on holiday in Germany? Well, we got a little something for you: The chatbot will answer questions about where and how to go based on your travel preferences. The chatbot will ask for the users’ preferences like “Do you like camping?” or “How do you like to travel? Train/Bus/Bike” and weigh those to create a customized recommendation suited for individual needs and wishes of the user. For this it would use decision trees and the ID3 algorithm. The output will be 3 recommendations for available holiday destinations, mode of transportation to the destination, accommodation and available activities.
